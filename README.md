# My First PHP Programs 

In this repository I have collected small PHP programs that I developed during a beginner level PHP programming course. Every assignment is located in their own folder and all files related is also included. There is also a detailed documentation about every programs functionality, and I feel that writing these documentations have really helped me to understand what I have done with the code. In this file I give a brief review about all assignments.

### What have I learned?

* Variables and control structure
* Conditional statements and loops
* Arrays
* File handlinig
* Functions
* Managing permanent data
* Information security

### Assignments
#### GRADES
This programs reads student grades from a text file. Every grade is upgraded by adding one, unless the grade is 5.

### BIGGEST AND SMALLEST VALUE
There is a form asking three numbers from user. After submitting the form, program prints the biggest and the smallest of given numbers.
