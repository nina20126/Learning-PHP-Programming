# My First PHP Programs 

In this repository I have collected small PHP programs that I developed during a beginner level PHP programming course. Every assignment is located in their own folder and all files related is also included. There is also a detailed documentation about every programs functionality. In this file I give a brief review about all assignments.

## What have I learned?

* Variables and control structure
* Conditional statements and loops
* Arrays
* File handlinig
* Functions
* Managing permanent data
* Information security
* Documenting my own work

## Assignments
**GRADES** This programs reads student grades from a text file. Every grade is upgraded by adding one, unless the grade is 5.

**BIGGEST AND SMALLEST VALUE** There is a form asking three numbers from user. After submitting the form, program prints the biggest and the smallest of given numbers.

**FORMAT TEXT** There is a form that is asking some text from user. The form has also four options that user can choose for formatting the input. Formatted text is printed below.  

**NUMBERS** Here I am generating a list of random number, arranging it in different ways and then doing little calculation with those numbers.
